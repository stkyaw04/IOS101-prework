## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apps I enjoy and why:

- Notion
    - Create databases to keep track of books/TV Shows I watch
    - Ability to customize the page with icons, images and GIFs
- Instagram
    - Save and organize videos I want to revisit into folders
    - Collaborate with others on saved video folders
- Snapchat
    - Instantly share snaps of what I'm doing
    - Save snap memories to look back on
    - Receive snap memories on anniversaries
- Spotify
    - Collaborate with others on playlists
    - Create and customize the look of playlists
- Google Calendar
    - Get reminders of scheduled events
    - Create time blocks and plan the week

Apps I would like to build:
     - A notes-like app where users can write down and store vocabulary they newly encountered/learned with definitions in their own words which also reinforces their understanding by quizzes throughout the day via widget or notifications. 
     - A social media-like app where users can collaborate on a folder of movies or shows they recommend or want to watch together. Similarly, this can be done for hangout spots or restaurants, etc. 

## Notes

- I couldn't really find the where some of the tools were at first but I learned to navigate it comfortably after some searches and help
